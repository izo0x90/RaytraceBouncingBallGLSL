#Bouncing ball, raytracing as basic as it gets.
Sphere "raytrace" rendering in GLSL, the lighting and transparency are faux effects just using the x distance and distance from 
"camera" and matching the pixel color to that of the fractal background.

The background is my favorite fractal x positon ^ y position of pixel, quick, dirty and beautiful.
